Participants 1 to 6 were ran on a wrong version of the code

I forgot to save the response for question 2 as an output, although the variable was saved in the .mat file.
The get_question2_resp.m file is a script to extract all the question 2 responses from the mat files.
These are then saved as question2_resp.csv and read into the R script
